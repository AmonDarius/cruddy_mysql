GETTING STARTED
============
If you leave the cruddy_mysql folder with the original name, you dont need to configure anything.

Please ensure that the root directory is writable.  This is where Cruddy Mysql will write three files:

	*crud_{SERVERNAME}.config.php - serialized array storing all your field configs and servers
	*crud_{SERVERNAME}.custom.functions.php - allows you to add custom PHP code when CRUDDY things happen to your database
	*crud_{SERVERNAME}.draw.functions.php - draws all of the tables - normally not edited much
	
Also ensure that cruddy_mysql/cache is writable
